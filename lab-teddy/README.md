# Overview
- This project was to teach us how to create algorithms for Binary search tree's and to see how they work. The hardest part for me was figuring out how to create the algorithms and how to append them to the tree.

# Algorithms
- the algorithms are:
BSTNode constructor,
`BSTNode.prototype.appendChild(node)`,
`BSNNode.prototype.max(val)`,
`BSNNode.prototype.min(val)`,
`BSNNode.prototype.find(val)`,

# Dependencties:
- Chai
- Mocha
